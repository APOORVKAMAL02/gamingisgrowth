            <h3>MOBILE GAMING</h3>
            <p>
                The mobile game industry is one of the highest performing industries globally in 2020.
                With a massive turnout of $77.2B in the just concluded year, there is no sign of slowing down in 2021.
                The mobile gaming industry recorded 12% more players in 2020 than in 2019, with over 2.5 billion players.
                Thankfully, mobile games are mature enough to have given rise to a vibrant and dedicated trade media.
                The editors, reporters, and professional contributors that make up this body of knowledge drawn from years of experience in this uniquely nuanced industry.
                Anyone looking to remain competitive, be they publisher, advertiser, or vendor, would do well to keep their finger on the pulse of these outlets and pay close attention to the stories they choose to cover.
                New trends like the rise of hyper-casual can have an earth-shattering impact overnight, and it’s the responsibility of publishers to stay up to date on how space is evolving.
                That means keeping a close eye on mergers and acquisitions, technologies, monetization practices, design trends, relevant legislation, and the myriad of other factors that make up the sophisticated world of mobile games.
                It’s no small feat, especially when you’ve got games to make and a business to run!
